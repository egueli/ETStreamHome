# E.T. Stream Home
An Android app to search music in an SFTP server, and to listen from it in streaming.

It's not ready for use yet. In fact, it's more like a container for some ideas I want to experiment, and to play with Android development. But feel free to browse the code and share ideas and comments ;)

This repo follows the git-flow paradigm. Switch branches to see what's going on.
